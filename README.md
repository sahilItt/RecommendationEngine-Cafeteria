# Project: Recommendation Engine (Cafeteria)


Absence of personalized food recommendations, ratings, feedback leading to suboptimal food 
choices for customers. This results in customer dissatisfaction and disinterest.

(Currently we donâ€™t have any system where employees can give their rating, views or feedback
on any food item. This system will help employees to give their recommendation and it will help 
the Chef to know the employee's interests.)
